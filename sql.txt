IN vs EXISTS:
------------
Performance : IN suitable for smaller sets in INNER QUERY, EXISTS for larger sets\
IN scans the entire result, EXISTS stops the scanning once match is found

select * from a where col1 in (select null);

select * from a where exists (select null);

---------------------------------

1) COLLECT STATS
2) Using proper PI and PPI(should be be in condition)
3) No FUNCTIONS in WHERE condition
4) Joining columns should be of same datatype
5) VOLATILE TABLE and STATS on them, DROP explicitly
6) Should use proper ALIASES
7) Avoid FTS use SI
8) if more values present in IN clause , insert those values in volatile table and inner join
