--Recursive query is set of 3 sub queries 
with recursive temp
(iteration,path,rem)as
(
--First Query
--Initializing the variables
--iteration is to calculate the number of iterations taken to process
--"temp" is a volatile table to put the generated rows in each step
select 0 as iteration, 
cast ('' as varchar(20)) as path,
str as rem
from rec
union all
--second query
--this is recursive query which executes until the condition fails in WHERE clause
select iteration+1,
path||case when substr(rem,1,1) in ('0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9') then substr(rem,1,1) else '' end ,
substr(rem,2) as rem
from temp
where characters(rem)>0
)
--Third Query
--This query gives the final desired output from the set of rows present in the "temp" table
select 
* from temp
where iteration>0
and rem='';

OUTPUT:
-------

Rows present the temp table

Iteration   Path    rem
------------------------
0          <blank>   s12r3.@4
1          <blank>   12r3.@4       --Path value is blank since 's' is not present in 0-9
2            1       2r3.@4
3            12      r3.@4
4            12      3.@4
5            123     .@4
6            123     @4
7            123     4
8            1234    <blank>

The above 9 rows will be present in "temp" table.
The desired output will be selected using the third query (WHERE rem=<blank>).The last row will be displayed
